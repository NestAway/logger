    * added formatter accessor to logger for dictating the way in which the
      logger should format the messages it displays.  Thanks to Nicholas Seckar
      (cf. [ruby-talk:153391]) and Daniel Berger.
    * added VERSION constant.
    * removed document for LogDevice.  It is an implementation detail and is
      not a public interface.
